    "Thus far in this assignment, we have collected tweets for each keyword and analyse them seperately. We have constructed the term-by-document matrix for each collection of tweets seperately. A fundemantal and common task in data science, analytics, machine learning, science and engineering is **clustering**. This is also known as unsupervised learning or exploratory data analysis as we have learned in our classes.\n",

    "This part of this assignment will use the Kmeans algorithm learned in our classes to cluster the **entire** colllection of tweets collected for **all** keywords. To do so, we need to compute the **distance** between **any** two pair of tweets. This requires us to compute a **joint** term-by-document matrix for all tweets.\n",

    "The reason that we **cannot** use the individual term-by-document matrices computed earlier (e.g.,***k1_termdoc, k2_termdoc, k3_termdoc***) for this task is because they have different dictionary sizes.
